# pyunihan
###### The name does not matter.

Processed data from Unihan (Unicode 14.0). Ready to use anywhere.

Explore the data directory:
* **Unihan_*.json** -- Converted data from all txt's which Unihan provided. *U+* codes are changed to actual characters.
* **sortkey.json** -- Simple keys for indexing or sorting. Some may have two keys. (Wiktionaries use it.)
* **sortkey-multiple.json** -- In case you want to use those two keys. This is already included in *sortkey.json*.
* **sortkey-rev.json** -- Reverse keys back to characters. It is convenience for some job.

Note: CJK Compatibility Ideographs and CJK Compatibility Ideographs Supplement are also included.

More to come in the future.
